## Project Structure
```
talentscout-hiring-assistant/
├── main.py              # Main application file
├── data/                # Directory for saved candidate data (auto-created)
├── .env                 # Environment variables (create this file)

```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

2. The application will start and open in your default web browser.

3. Interview Process:
   - The assistant greets the candidate and asks for their name
   - Collects basic information (email, phone, experience, desired position, location)
   - Gathers details about the candidate's tech stack
   - Generates and asks technical questions based on the provided information
   - Concludes the interview and informs the candidate about next steps

4. Reset Functionality:
   - Use the "Reset Conversation" button in the sidebar to start a new interview
   - This will clear all current candidate data and conversation history

## Customization

### Modifying Technical Questions
You can customize how technical questions are generated by editing the `generate_technical_questions()` function in `main.py`. Adjust the prompt or generation parameters as needed.

### Changing the Interview Flow
To modify the interview stages or questions, edit the `process_user_input()` function and the various stage conditions within it.

### Styling the UI
The application uses Streamlit's default styling. You can customize the appearance by adding Streamlit theming options to a `.streamlit/config.toml` file.

## Data Storage
Candidate data is saved in JSON format in the `data/` directory. Each file is named with a timestamp and contains:
- Candidate personal information
- Complete conversation history
- Technical questions and answers

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter issues with the reset button, check the error message in the debug info panel
- For API-related errors, verify your API key and check your internet connection
- If technical questions aren't generating properly, try adjusting the fallback questions logic
